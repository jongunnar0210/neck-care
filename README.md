This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This is a typical NextJS web application. It uses the App Router as opposed to the older Page Router. It's styled with SCSS.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## TODO

We might want to localize this app so that more than just English is supported, with Locize (https://locize.com/?lng=en) or something.
I would lean towards keeping it simple and only use English to save ourselves headaches. Another thing is that the buttons don't do anything
right now so we could add that. We could add a dark theme. We could add both loading and hover animations. We might want to create a figma design
for both desktop and mobile (even tablets) - and then change the styling of the code accordigly. And we could add sub pages.
